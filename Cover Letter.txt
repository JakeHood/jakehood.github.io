Hi my name is Jake, I just graduated from the University of Gloucestershire as a games Programmer, I also did 2 years of games designer in college. I lead a small team of people to create the game Bound in Time in UE5 in which I was a programmer and did time management for each playtest deadline. This allowed the team to see what areas needed to be focused on working towards the next deadline. Which won best game at GameX 2025. I also worked as an intern at World Makers on the game Deceit 2, helping with balancing and new ideas for roles for the game as well as testing them to find bugs and see if they are fun. I play games a lot so I have a good understanding of balance at higher levels of play and what players generally find to be more fun gameplay elements. I am currently working in a small team for a project to develop new skills in UE5. I also play test for a few different games helping with balance while keeping the game fun and interesting to players.
